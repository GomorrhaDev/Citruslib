            On the server-side (here!), the players are eventually put on the same team.
            the function, as is, sometimes doesnt work because of lag and stuff. Generally its a good idea NOT to spam this function.

            changing teams and gear mid match causes issue with that.
            run this code AFTER calling set team or set gear.
            this is seperate from those function because you might be calling set team/gear many times and dont need redundant uses of this function.
            it also only needs to be called on players who have had people *join* their team...
